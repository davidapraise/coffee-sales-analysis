KEY INSIGHTS  

  —— Lattes generate the highest revenue, contributing 24% of the machine's total revenue.  
  —— Card payments dominate 98% of transactions.  
  —— Morning hours, from 06:00 to 12:00, produce 40% of all sales.  
  —— Weekends show lower transactions, which indicates lower activity likely due to the machine's location.  
  —— Sales volume is higher earlier in the year, though this may be due to the dataset starting March 2024.
